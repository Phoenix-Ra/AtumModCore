# AtumModCore
This is a library for the mods, which I use to provide more results within shorter time in a long-term projects

It already has an easy to use configuration system and powerful display library that helps with development of custom screens, guis and HUD.


Within next few months major work on it will be finished.
After that I will write the good documentation and make it support more mc versions.
Currently only 1.12.2 is supported.
Planned to support:
- 1.8
- 1.12
- 1.16
- 1.18
- latest

Used in projects:
